Village Chief: Impressive! So you can help us.
Katana: I am new to this, but with my grandfather's help, we can help bring your village back to life and defeat the wizard.
Village Chief: Thank you! Thank you! I will send my messenger the squirrel to accompany you in this journey. Be careful, as the evil wizard has left many traps.



Village Chief: Grand Guru! Help us please! \n Nothing is growing without the crystal! Grand Guru: I have brought my grandchild Katana. I am passing on to her the gift of words. Village Chief: But she is so young! Grand Guru: Let me show you. Katana, say the French for flower.
